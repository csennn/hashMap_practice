# hashMap_practice
In this example, the method getMostFrequent(List<Integer> list) takes a list of integers as input and returns the most frequent element with the lowest value. The HashMap stores the frequency of each element, and the two for-loops iterate through the HashMap to find the element with the highest frequency and the lowest value.

You can test it by calling the method with a sample list:

List<Integer> list = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 5);
System.out.println(getMostFrequent(list));

Output:
3
